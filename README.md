This is my CA report for the Human Computer Interaction module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

The report is about the redesign of the Daily Mail website to improve the user experience. Based on user research and design theory, a key issue in the website's digital interface is identified, and design research is conducted to solve the problem. A paper prototype is developed to demonstrate the redesign, and an appropriate evaluation methodology is used to evaluate the prototype.
