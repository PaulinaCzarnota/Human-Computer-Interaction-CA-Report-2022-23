This is my CA 2 report for the Human Computer Interaction module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

This report presents a redesign of the Daily Mail website with the goal of improving the user experience. The report identified a key issue in the website's digital interface based on user research and design theory. A design research process was then carried out to solve the problem. To demonstrate the redesign, a paper prototype was developed, and an appropriate evaluation methodology was used to assess the effectiveness of the prototype. The report provides an overview of the user research conducted in CA 1, presents a problem statement, outlines the design research process, showcases the paper prototype, and evaluates the effectiveness of the prototype.
