This repository contains my second Continuous Assessment report for the Human-Computer Interaction module, completed in the second year of my Computer Science degree at TU Dublin.

# Project Overview

This report documents the **redesign of the Daily Mail website** with a focus on enhancing user experience. Building upon the insights gathered in CA 1, I identified core usability issues and applied design theory to propose targeted improvements.

### Key Components
- **Problem Statement**: Defines the primary user experience challenge on the Daily Mail website.
- **User Research Summary**: Recaps findings from CA 1 to inform the redesign approach.
- **Design Research Process**: Details the research and design activities undertaken to address the identified issues.
- **Paper Prototype**: Presents a low-fidelity prototype showcasing the redesigned interface.
- **Evaluation Methodology**: Describes the methodology used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed redesign.

### Grade Received: 84%

This report demonstrates the design thinking process, from identifying user pain points to developing and evaluating a prototype solution. Explore the repository to see how the redesign aligns with HCI principles to improve the overall user experience!
